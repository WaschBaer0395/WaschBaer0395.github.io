# StarCitizen Joystick Tool
This tool will eventually allow uploading a .xml mapping to generate a cheat sheet with images and bindings, and or rebind keys withoyt having to go into starcitizen

## Planned Features

- Auto generation of a mapping image
- rebinding of mappings
- extras like allowing double triple quadruple *insert insane high number of taps* taps
- flipping instances if lets say one joystick was detected as instance 1 although it was supposed to be instance 2
- easy expansion by using (dont quote me on that) figma to create components containing a joystick and all its possible mappings in a good readable manner
